    "## How to add in binary\n",
    "\n",
    "This works just like what we learned in elementary school:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lay the numbers represented in binary one above the other. For example the numbers `21` and `26` are in binary `10101` and `11010` respectively\n",
    "1. Sum each column from right to left below the line\n",
    "1. If the sum requires two digits (bits) to represent, carry the left bit (at the `10`s place) to the next column and place the right bit (at the `1`s place) under the line\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image, the numbers `21` and `26` are added together in binary. The digit in orange represents the only carry bit that is `1`. The sum is `101111` which is `47` in decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 30%\" src=\"images/binary_add.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary addition of two bits\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding two binary digits (bits) with logic gates is easy. The sum can be computed with a single exclusive OR operation and a single AND of the bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exclusive OR, which is called `XOR` for short does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 30%\" src=\"images/xor.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AND` operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 30%\" src=\"images/and.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The result (i.e. the output) of the `XOR` operation is called the _sum_ and the result of the `AND` operation is called the _carry_.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Half adder\n",
    "\n",
    "When we combine the output of these two gates we get a _half adder_, which takes two bits and computes their _sum_ and _carry_:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 60%\" src=\"images/half_adder.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Carry\n",
    "\n",
    "The result from `A AND B` is called the _carry_ bit because it is used to carry the overflow from the summation to the next one. However the next adder now needs to add three bits: `A + B + C` in order to include the carry bit from the previous computation. This is why we need to create a binary adder for three bits which is called a full adder.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** The carry bit is on if and only if there was overflow in the summation. The terms _carry_ and _overflow_ are therefore used interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving in to the full adder let's see how we could use two half adders for adding two two-bit numbers together and where it would fail. We will ignore the carry bits as there is no way to take them into account with the half adders.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 30%\" src=\"images/success.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "When the addition of the individual digits never overflows, the carry is 0 and the sum is correct: $1 + 2 = 3$. However if there is overflow, the carry is not zero and the sum is incorrect:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 30%\" src=\"images/fail.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "$1 + 3 = 2$ is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "We simply need more adding capabilities to include the carry bits in the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Full adder\n",
    "\n",
    "A _full adder_ takes three bits `A`, `B` and `C` as input and outputs two bits `CARRY` and `SUM`. The half adder only took two bits as input. The full adder solves our problem, where with a half adder we could not include the carry bits in the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full adder operates like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 60%\" src=\"images/full_adder.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A full adder can be made from two half adders and an OR gate. With $N$ full adders we can finaly add any two $N$-digit binary number together. Here's what it looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`A = 10101` (21 in decimal) and `B = 10111` (23 in decimal) are added together. The carry output from each column's full adder is moved over to the `C` input of the next columns. Each column requires one full adder except for the rightmost one.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If there was something to carry from the leftmost column, we would have what's called _integer overflow_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of the numbers is in the `SUM` register.\n",
